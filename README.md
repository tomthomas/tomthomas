- 👋 Hi, I’m Tom. Welcome to my page. 
- 👀 My areas of interest are predictive modeling, and the use of effective visualizations. 
<!--- - 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use various analytics tools. --->
- 💞️ If you have an interesting pro-bono project, or non-profit ventures to build low-cost effective solutions, or anything related with Effective Altruism (bar longtermism), I would be interested. Feel free to reach out to me.
